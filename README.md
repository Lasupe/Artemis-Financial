# Artemis-Financial

A mid-sized financial services company, Artemis Financial focuses on investment management and digital transactions. To preserve regulatory compliance and safeguard sensitive financial data, the business had to make its IT applications more secure.


Weak authentication mechanisms, insufficient data encryption, and vulnerability to typical security threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) were among the flaws in Artemis Financial's online application. Finding these vulnerabilities, protecting the application, and enhancing overall cybersecurity resilience were the main objectives.

Using techniques including manual code review, penetration testing, and static code analysis, I successfully found and recorded software vulnerabilities. Prioritizing the most important security threats using industry-standard frameworks such as the OWASP Top 10 was one of my approach's advantages.

Writing secure code is essential for thwarting cyberattacks, safeguarding user information, and preserving client confidence.  Secure software lowers the possibility of expensive breaches and guarantees adherence to financial standards.  Artemis Financial improved its operational stability and reputation by putting security best practices into effect.

Finding a balance between program performance and usability and security improvements was one of the difficulties.  Extensive testing and restructuring were also necessary to uncover hidden vulnerabilities in legacy code.  Nonetheless, this experience reaffirmed how crucial safe coding standards and automated testing are.

I implemented a number of security layers, such as role-based access control (RBAC), encryption for sensitive data, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).  I would keep evaluating vulnerabilities and identifying the most effective mitigation solutions in future evaluations by utilizing automated scanning tools, threat modeling approaches, and penetration testing.

I carried out thorough unit testing, integration testing, and security audits after rewriting the code to make sure no new vulnerabilities were created.  In order to identify such risks instantly, I also examined records and put continuous monitoring into place.

Some valuable tools and best practices included:

Static & Dynamic Analysis: SonarQube, Burp Suite
Penetration Testing: OWASP ZAP, Metasploit
Coding Standards: Secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP, NIST)
Version Control & CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub, Jenkins, Docker
Showcasing Work to Future Employers.

I would provide documentation of penetration test findings, code samples with security updates done, and before-and-after security assessment reports to show my proficiency.  These resources demonstrate my proficiency in locating, addressing, and averting software vulnerabilities.
